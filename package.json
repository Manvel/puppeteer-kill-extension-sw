  "description": "There is no API available for killing Browser Extensions Service Worker. One way to do manually is from the `chrome://serviceworker-internals` page. But the problem is that if puppeteer is used for opening the page and programmatically clicking on the `stop` button of the extension service worker item, the Service Worker doesn't start at all unless reloading the extension. Meaning wake-up events doesn't start Service Worker again and even clicking `Start` button in `chrome://serviceworker-internals` doesn't work.",
